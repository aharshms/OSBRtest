# Bud Runtime Lite - _Frugal & Practical GenAI For Everyone_ 

Bud Runtime is an opinionated platform that simplifies the setup, experimentation, management, and scaling of compound AI systems. It is intended to be the foundational layer that provides all the tools necessary for the deployment of GenAI applications and their lifecycle management, with a focus on optimizing cost-efficiency and scalability. 

### ***One Platform For Everything GenAI***

A GenAI deployment involves many moving parts—such as the operating system, runtime, inference stack, performance analysis stack, evaluation stack, red-teaming system, data source integrations, prompt layer, agent layer, and more. Relying on a multitude of different tools to manage these components adds complexity and creates technical debt.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ***Our goal is to create a unified GenAI stack that incorporates all of these components, with optimized workflows focused on performance, usability, and security.***


### Bud Runtime is built upon five core principles. ###

- ***Optimize for humans as well as AI :*** The platform offers an intuitive UI for humans and an easy-to-consume, structured, decoupled, and automatically orchestrated layer for AI systems. The upcoming *Ask Bud* feature is an AI agent that can automatically create, manage, and scale GenAI systems and agents on its own with a simple prompt. Bud Runtime’s microservices, built on top of Dapr, natively support MCP (Model Context Protocol) so that every component and service can be used by an AI agent in the future.
  
- ***Be as frugal as possible:*** Enable cost reduction for GenAI deployments through all possible methods, including caching, compression, simulators, auto-quantizers, heterogeneous clusters, and multi-cloud deployments. The platform also enables cost-aware deployments with cost estimates and forecasts.
  
- ***Build for scalability :***  Bud runtime is designed to be the foundational GenAI layer for any organization, and we believe it is crucial for this layer to be highly performant, stable, and scalable. Every component of the Bud stack is selected, benchmarked, and analyzed based on these criteria.
  
- ***Expect no expertise:*** Make every component as non-technical or guided as possible, with zero jargon or technical expectations. The platform's objective is to make the deployment, management, and scaling of GenAI as simple as managing a basic website.
  
- ***Have an opinion:***  The platform should have its opinion on best practices, optimizations, workflows, and systems. There are many moving parts in a GenAI system, and one poor design decision can cost millions. Therefore, we must focus on best practices, system components, and workflows rather than arbitrary flexibility.
